Baseball Scorecard Generator offers a Python API to generate a PDF scorecard
of a given baseball game.

This project is heavily based on the work by Chris Nandor
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/pudge/files/Games_Baseball_Scorecard/),
and uses a modified version of the Metapost scorecard template created by
Christopher Swingley (https://swingleydev.com/baseball/scorecards.php).
